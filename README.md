# odin-sketchpad

Learning from this project:

- Accessing and setting CSS properties through Javascript.
- Using flexbox to create a grid of elements and automatically filling the gridcontainer
  neatly regardless of the size of each square.
- User prompts as input.
- slicing and parsing strings to get a usable number from a CSS property.
- eventlisteners on buttons created dynamically
- Considering when to execute code (when DOM is loaded, deferred scripts)
- Using Media Queries in Javascript to resize the sketchpad based on screen width
- Variable scope and function hoisting
- Considering how to consolidate longer bits of code into functions
